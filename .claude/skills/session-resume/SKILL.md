# Session Resume — Automatic Context Recovery

Auto-loads on every session to maintain development continuity. Reads the latest
session document, recent git history, and work-in-progress state so you never
start cold.

## Live Context (auto-injected)

### Latest Session Document
!`ls -t ${CC_SESSION_DOCS_DIR:-docs}/SESSION_*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1`

### Recent Git Activity
!`git log --oneline -10 2>/dev/null`

### Current Branch Status
!`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null`
!`git status --short 2>/dev/null | head -5`

### Uncommitted Work-in-Progress
!`git diff --name-only 2>/dev/null | head -10`
!`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard 2>/dev/null | head -10`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check if Context is Fresh

If you already have detailed knowledge of the current work state (e.g., from
MEMORY.md loaded into the system prompt), skip to Step 4.

### Step 2: Read Latest Session Document

Read the most recent session document shown in the live context above. Extract:
- **Completed work**: What was accomplished last session
- **Continuation point**: Exact next step identified
- **Pending tasks**: Any TODO items or planned work
- **Key decisions**: Architectural or design choices made

### Step 3: Check for Work-in-Progress

Look at uncommitted changes and untracked files from the live context:
- **Modified files**: Work started but not committed
- **Untracked files**: New code being developed
- **Staged changes**: Work ready to commit

### Step 4: Greet and Brief

Provide a brief status when the session starts:

```
Welcome back. Here is where we left off:

Branch: [branch] ([clean/dirty])
Last session: [date] - [brief summary]
Continuation point: [next planned task]
[Any uncommitted work or WIP noted]

Ready to continue with [next task], or would you prefer to work on something else?
```

If the session context mentions "FIRST SESSION", provide an extended welcome:

```
Welcome to cognitive-core!

Agents: [list from context]
Top skills to try:
  /code-review        — Review code against project standards
  /pre-commit         — Lint staged files before committing
  /fitness            — Check project quality metrics
  @test-specialist    — Create or update tests

See .claude/AGENTS_README.md for the full agent routing guide.
```

For subsequent sessions, use the standard brief greeting.

Keep this brief (3-5 lines). Do not dump the entire session doc.

### Step 5: If User Asks to "Remember" or "Refresh"

If the user explicitly asks to refresh context:
1. Read the full latest session document
2. Read MEMORY.md for persistent cross-session notes
3. Check recent commit messages for work stream context
4. Read any referenced implementation plans
5. Provide a comprehensive summary

## Session State Machine

This skill is the entry point for the session lifecycle:

```
Fresh → Active → Compacted → Resumed → Ended
```

| Transition | Trigger | This Skill's Role |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Fresh → Active | First user message | Loads context, greets, transitions to Active |
| Compacted → Resumed | Context compaction + new message | Re-invoked to reconstruct context |
| Ended → Fresh | New conversation | Auto-loads as Fresh state |

### What Is Preserved vs Reconstructed

| Context | Method | Reliability |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Key Rules (CLAUDE.md) | `compact-reminder.sh` re-injects | Always preserved |
| Cross-session notes | MEMORY.md (persistent file) | Always preserved |
| Git state | Repository (immutable history) | Always preserved |
| Last session summary | SESSION_*.md (persistent file) | Always preserved |
| Conversation history | Context window only | Lost after compaction |
| Agent delegation results | Context window only | Lost after compaction |
| Intermediate reasoning | Context window only | Not recoverable |

When resuming after compaction, prioritize **reconstructable** state (git, files)
over conversation replay. Do not attempt to recover lost intermediate reasoning --
re-derive from current state if needed.

## Notes

- This skill auto-loads on every session -- keep it lean
- The `!`command`` sections inject live state at load time
- Session docs follow the pattern `SESSION_*.md` in the configured docs directory
- For cross-machine sync, use `/session-sync` separately
